% BEGIN: Introduction
\section{Introduction}

\begin{note}
In this tutorial we will look at the open source software package QIIME (pronounced 'chime').
\end{note}

QIIME stands for Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology. The package contains many tools that enable users to analyse and compare microbial communities. QIIME was originally developed to analyse of Roche 454 amplicon sequencing data. In the latest versions workflows have been added to analyze data from different sequencing platforms, such as Illumina, and different types of data, such as shotgun data. In this course we will use QIIME 1.8, which is the latest version.

After completion of this tutorial, you should be able to perform a taxonomic analysis on a Illumina pair end MiSeq 16S rRNA amplicon dataset. In addition you should be able to do 16S taxonomic analysis on shotgun data using the tool rRNASelector in combination with QIIME
% END: Introduction


\section{De novo OTU picking and diversity analysis using Illumina data}

We will re-analyze the data from Sommer et al. (2016). The Gut Microbiota Modulates Energy Metabolism in the Hibernating Brown Bear Ursus arctos. Sommer et al., 2016, Cell Reports 14, 1655â€“1661 February 23, 2016. An electronic copy of the paper can be found in your Taxonomy folder. When you have to wait a few minutes for commands to complete, use the time to acquaint yourself with the study. It is a good example of a study that combines the power of next-generation sequencing with environmental observations/measurements.

The analysis we do follows the pipeline described in the QIIME general tutorial (\url{http://qiime.org/tutorials/tutorial.html}). Feel free to look at this tutorial for further background information. The dataset used in the tutorial is a subset of the Sommer data. In some parts of the analysis steps we have precomputed analysis on the complete data set for comparison. 

% BEGIN: Join directory of PE reads
\subsection{Join directory of PE reads}

\begin{information}
For this tutorial we will analyse the bear data dataset to complete the necessary steps in a reasonable amount of time.
\end{information}

\begin{steps}

First we need to join the Illumina Pair End (PE) reads contained in the bear read directory.

\begin{lstlisting}

cd ~/taxonomy
multiple_join_paired_ends.py -i bear_reads -o bear_join --read1_indicator _1  --read2_indicator _2

\end{lstlisting}

\end{steps}
% END: Join directory of PE reads

\subsection{The Mapping File}

\begin{information}
We will use the mapping file 'mapping.txt' to associate read data with one of 23 samples.
Note that this file has to be created for each analysis, as the information is specific for an experiment. The mapping file can also contain information on your experimental design. The format is very strict; columns are separated with a single TAB character; the header names have to be typed exactly as specified in the documentation. A good sample description is useful as it is used in the legends of the figures QIIME generates. We could also specify the reverse primer and remove it from the reads. Unfortunately, the reverse primer sequence was not in the paper, and we'll ignore it though we could probably deduce it from longer reads: as a 466 bp region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene flanking the V3 and V4 regions was amplified, you'll have a clue where to look for the reverse primer.

\end{information}

\begin{steps}
Execute the following command and test the mapping file for potential errors:
\begin{lstlisting}
less -S mapping.txt
validate_mapping_file.py -m mapping.txt -o mapping_output
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

\begin{note}
There shouldn't be any errors. If there are errors, a corrected mapping file will be written to the directory mapping\_output
\end{note}
%END: The Mapping File

% BEGIN: Assign reads to the samples
\subsection{Assign samples to the reads}

\begin{information}
This step sets up and quality filters the sample reads by sample identities
\end{information}

\begin{steps}
Next we will assign reads to the samples and quality filter at phred quality threshold >= Q20 to joined reads for analysis

\begin{lstlisting}

multiple_split_libraries_fastq.py -i bear_join -o bear_split -m sampleid_by_file --include_input_dir_path  -p parameter_file.txt

\end{lstlisting}

\end{steps}
% END: Assign reads to the samples

\begin{questions}
When completed please enter the directory 'bear\_split' and have a look at the log file. It contains detailed information what was done during the step we've just performed. Note that the number of reads assigned to the different samples varies considerably. Knowing where the individual samples were taken may give a clue why this may be! Next have a quick look at the file seqs.fna. What has changed to the header of the reads?

\begin{answer}
Look at the split libraries results
\end{answer}

\end{questions}

\begin{steps}

You will see the reads are now batched to their sample.

\begin{lstlisting}
cd split_library_output
ls -l
less split_library_log.txt
less -S seqs.fna

\end{lstlisting}

\end{steps}
% END: Questions and Answers

% BEGIN: Picking Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)
\section{Picking Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)}
We will now use a workflow for de novo OTU picking, taxonomy assignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and OTU table construction QIIME has several workflows to pick OTUs, we will be using the one described in the general overview tutorial (\url{http://qiime.org/tutorials/tutorial.html}) It has 7 steps, which are described in some detail in this tutorial. 
The described procedure is run with the command from the Taxonomy directory. This step takes about 12mins to run. Please read through the different steps (\url{http://qiime.org/tutorials/tutorial.html}) and try to understand the procedure. Remember that an OTU is not the same as a species, but a 'bag/cluster' of highly similar sequences (at least 97\% is common for bacteria/archaea), or a single sequence in case of rare OTUs.

\begin{steps}
Pick de novo OTUs:

\begin{lstlisting}
pick_de_novo_otus.py -i bear_split/seqs.fna -o otus   
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

\begin{note}

Please do spend some time looking at the output of this pipeline. In particular the file 'seqs\_rep\_set\_tax\_assignments.txt' in the 'uclust\_assigned\_taxonomy' directory. By default QIIME uses the Greengenes 16S reference database to assign taxonomy. It has the following levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. It will be immediately clear that most reads cannot be classified up to species level.
As described in step 6 of the QIIME overview tutorial, the pipeline creates a Newick-formatted phylogenetic tree (rep\_set.tre) in the otus directory. You can run the program 'figtree' from the terminal, a graphic interface will be launched by typing 'figtree' then hit the return key.

View the tree by opening the file 'rep\_set.tre' in the 'otus' folder (Desktop->Taxonomy->otus). The tree that is produced is too complex to be of much use. We will look at a different tool, Megan 5, which produces a far more useful tree.
In step 7 of the QIIME overview tutorial a file called otu\_table.biom is generated. It is in biom-format, which is increasingly supported by taxonomic software developers. One of the tools that support the BIOM format is Megan (\url{http://ab.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/software/megan5/}). Megan is a standalone tool for analyzing both taxonomic and functional content of datasets. It is free for academic use, but you will need to request a licence first. We will use Megan version 5 to display a taxonomic tree using the BIOM output we have just produced.
Note: Sequence errors can give rise to spurious OTUs, we can filter out OTUs that only contain a single sequence (singletons). QIIME allows you to do this quite easily â€“ or you could also remove abundant taxa if you are more interested in rare taxa.

\end{note}

\begin{steps}
To remove singletons, run the following commands:
\begin{lstlisting}
cd otus
filter_otus_from_otu_table.py -i otu_table.biom -o otu_table_no_singletons.biom -n 2

\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

\begin{note}
This removes OTUs with less than 2 sequences. If you use the â€“k option instead of the â€“n option, OTUs with more than the specified number of sequences will be removed.
\end{note}

\begin{steps}
Megan can be opened from the terminal by typing MEGAN. If you are asked for a licence select the following file 
\begin{lstlisting}
/mnt/workshop/data/HT_MEGAN5_registration_for_academic_use.txt 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

\begin{note}
From the File menu select Import -> BIOM format. Find your biom file and import it. Megan will generate a tree that is far more informative than the one produced with FigTree. You can change the way Megan displays the data by clicking on the various icons and menu items. Please spend some time exploring your data. The Word Cloud visualization is interesting, too, if you want to find out which samples are similar and which samples stand out.
\end{note}
% END: Picking Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)

% BEGIN: View OTU statistics
\section{View OTU statistics}

\begin{information}
You can generate some statistics, e.g. the number of reads assigned, distribution among samples. Some of the statistics are useful for further downstream analysis, e.g. beta-diversity analysis. Run the following now, again from within the Taxonomy directory, and look at the results. Write down the minimum value under Counts/sample summary. We need it for beta-diversity analysis
\end{information}

\begin{steps}
\begin{lstlisting}
cd ../
biom summarize-table -i otus/otu_table.biom -o otus/otu_table_summary.txt
less otus/otu_table_summary.txt
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}
% END: View OTU statistics

\section{Visualize taxonomic composition}
We will now group sequences by taxonomic assignment at various levels. The following command produces a number of charts that can be viewed in a browser. The command takes about 5 minutes to complete


\begin{steps}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=command_syntax]
summarize_taxa_through_plots.py -i otus/otu_table.biom -o  wf_taxa_summary -m mapping.txt 

\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

\begin{steps}
To view the output, open a web browser from the Applications -> Internet menu. You can use Google chrome, Firefox or Chromium.
In Google chrome or Chromium, type CTRL-O, or in Firefox use the File menu to select Desktop ->Taxonomy -> wf\_taxa\_summary -> taxa\_summary\_plots and open either area\_charts.html or bar\_chars.html. I prefer the bar charts myself. The top chart visualizes taxonomic composition at phylum level for each of the samples. The next chart goes down to class level and following charts go another level up again. The charts (particularly the ones more at the top) are very useful for discovering how the communities in your samples differ from each other. There is a similar plot in the paper, if you have time, see how our analysis compares with the one described in the paper.

\end{steps}
% END: Visualize taxonomic composition

% BEGIN: Alpha diversity
\section{Alpha diversity within samples and rarefaction curves}

Alpha diversity is the microbial diversity within a sample. QIIME can calculate a lot of metrics, but for our tutorial, we generate 3 metrics from the alpha rarefaction workflow: chao1 (estimates species richness); observed species metric (the count of unique OTUs); phylogenetic distance. The following workflow generates rarefaction plots to visualize alpha diversity.

\begin{steps}
Run the following command from within your taxonomy directory, this should take a few minutes:
\begin{lstlisting}
alpha_rarefaction.py -i otus/otu_table.biom -m mapping.txt -o wf_arare -t otus/rep_set.tre
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

First we are going to view the rarefaction curves in a web browser by opening /home/trainee/Desktop/Taxonomy/sutton/wf\_arare/alpha\_rarefaction\_plots/rarefaction\_plots.html. 
To start select as metric 'chao1' and select as category 'Description'. It is clear that the microbial diversity in some samples is much higher than in other samples. Click around in the legend as this will help you work out which line corresponds with which sample. If you have time you could try to correlate species richness with environmental data from the paper and establish whether our analysis confirms the findings of the authors.
Next view the precomputed rarefaction curves which show an increased sequencing depth.

In general the more reads you have, the more OTUs you will observe. If a rarefaction curve start to flatten, it means that you have probably sequenced at sufficient depth, in other words, producing more reads will not significantly add more OTUs. If on the other hand hasn't flattened, you have not sampled enough to capture enough of the microbial diversity and by extrapolating the curve you may be able to estimate how many more reads you will need. Consult the QIIME overview tutorial for further information.

\begin{steps}
Run the following command from within your taxonomy directory, this should take a few minutes to generate a heatmap of the level three taxonomy:
\begin{lstlisting}
make_otu_heatmap.py -i taxa_summary/otu_table_L3.biom -o taxa_summary/otu_table_L3_heatmap.pdf -c Treatment -m mapping.txt
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}
% END: Alpha diversity

% BEGIN: Beta diversity
\section{Beta diversity and beta diversity plots}

Before we have a quick look at taxonomic analysis of shotgun data, we have a quick look at beta diversity analysis, which is the assessment of differences between microbial communities. As we have already observed, our samples contain different numbers of sequences. 
The first step is to remove sample heterogeneity by randomly selecting the same number of reads from every sample. This number corresponds to the 'minimum' number recorded when you looked at the OTU statistics. 

\begin{steps}
Now run the following command
\begin{lstlisting}
beta_diversity_through_plots.py -i otus/otu_table.biom -m mapping.txt -o bdiv_even -t otus/rep_set.tre -e 23183

\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

Read through the beta diversity compute section of the QIIME overview tutorial and try to understand this workflow. Tomorrow we will look at visualization of beta diversity analysis results in more detail. Unfortunately we cannot view the PCoA plots that we have just generated using the NeCTAR image as WebGL is not supported. Precomputed plots can be viewed using the browser on your computer, we will make the link available.
% END: Beta diversity

% BEGIN: Shotgun 16S
\section{Closed reference OTU picking of 16S ribosomal rRNA fragments selected from a shotgun data set}

In a closed-reference OTU picking process, reads are clustered against a reference sequence collection and any reads, which do not hit a sequence in the reference sequence collection, are excluded from downstream analyses. In QIIME, pick\_closed\_reference\_otus.py is the primary interface for closed-reference OTU picking in QIIME. If the user provides taxonomic assignments for sequences in the reference database, those are assigned to OTUs. We could use this approach to perform taxonomic analysis on shotgun data. We need to perform the following steps:\\
1.	Extract those reads from the data set that contain 16S ribosomal RNA sequence. If there are less than (e.g.) 100 nucleotides of rRNA sequence, the read should be discarded.\\
2.	Remove non-rRNA sequence (flanking regions) from those reads\\
3.	Run closed-reference OTU picking workflow\\
4.	Visualise the results, e.g. in Megan\\

\section{Extraction of 16S rRNA sequence-containing reads with rRNASelector}

We will analyze an Illumina paired-end dataset that has been drastically reduced in size for this tutorial, while preserving the majority of the 16S containing reads. The dataset is from the metagenome described at \url{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3772140/}. There is a pdf in the working directory for this part of the tutorial. This is a paired end dataset, and where read pairs overlapped, they were merged into a single sequence. If read pairs did not overlap, both reads were included in the analysis. QC was performed using the EBI Metagenomics pipeline.
We will use a tool called rRNASelector, which is freely available (\url{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21887657}) to select our 16S rRNA sequence containing reads.  The tool invokes hmmsearch and uses trained hidden Markov models to detect reads with 16S rRNA sequence. The tool also trims the reads so that only 16S rRNA sequence is present in the fasta file we will feed into the QIIME workflow.

\begin{steps}
First, we need to go to our working directory.
You will find a file called A7A-paired.fasta containing the sequence reads.
Fire up rRNASelector from the command line.

\begin{lstlisting}
cd ~/Desktop/Taxonomy/A7A/
rRNASelector
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

A graphical interface should appear. Note interaction with the interface may have a few seconds lag. Load the sequence file by clicking on 'File Choose' at the top and navigate to the file A7A-paired.fasta. Select the file and click 'Open'. The tool will automatically fill in file names for the result files. Change the Number of CPUs to '2', select Prokaryote 16S (to include both bacterial and archaeal 16S sequences) and specify the location of the hmmsearch file by clicking the second 'File Choose' button. Type in manually the location '/usr/bin/hmmsearch', then click process. The run should take a few minutes to complete.

If all went well, you can close rRNASelector by clicking on Exit. You will have 3 new files in your directory, one containing untrimmed 16S reads, one containing trimmed 16S reads (A7A-paired.prok.16s.trim.fasta; that's the one we want) and a file containing reads that do not contain (sufficient) 16S sequence.

\section{Closed-reference OTU picking workflow and visualization of results in Megan 5}
\begin{steps}
We are now ready to pick our OTUs. We do that by running the following command (all on one line and no space after gg\_otus-12-10):

\begin{lstlisting}
pick_closed_reference_otus.py -i A7A-paired.prok.16s.trim.fasta -o ./cr_uc -r /mnt/workshop/tools/qiime_software/gg_otus-12_10-release/rep_set/97_otus.fasta -t /mnt/workshop/tools/qiime_software/gg_otus-12_10-release/taxonomy/97_otu_taxonomy.txt
\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}

\begin{steps}
We need to specify the following options. 
The command will take several minutes to run. When finished open Megan as described before, import the otu\_table.biom file and explore the results.

\begin{lstlisting}
-i input_file.fasta
-o output_directory
-r /path/to/reference_sequences
-t /path/to/reference_taxonomy

\end{lstlisting}
\end{steps}
% END: Shotgun

\section{Bonus}

If there is time left you could go back to the Polar bear study. The aim of this study was to understand interrelationship among microbial community composition, in hibernating bears and effects on laboratory mice. With additional information from the paper, could you come up with some conclusions? 

Check the results from the ribosomal database classifier, how do these differ from the QIIME default GreenGenes (gg\_otus\_97) database classifier results? What can you conclude?

The QIIME overview tutorial at \url{http://qiime.org/tutorials/tutorial.html} has a number of additional steps that you may find interesting; so feel free to try some of them out. Note hat we have not installed Cytoscape, so we cannot visualize OTU networks.

We will end this tutorial with a 15-minute summary of what we have done and how well our analysis compares with the one in the paper.

Hopefully you will have acquired new skills that allow you to tackle your own taxonomic analyses. There are many more tutorials on the QIIME website that can help you pick the best strategy for your project (\url{http://qiime.org/tutorials/}). We picked QIIME for this tutorial as it is widely used and supported, but there are alternatives that might suit your need better (e.g. VAMPS at \url{http://vamps.mbl.edu}; mothur at \url{http://www.mothur.org} and others).
